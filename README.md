# OrangePiOne-DietPi
An image of DietPi for the orange pi one SBC.




Based on an armbian image and converted into a DietPi system.
The whole system has been compressed into an image by using the dietpi-imager script and DD.
Some dependencies had to be added to make the conversion work, the armbian keychain had to be modified.
